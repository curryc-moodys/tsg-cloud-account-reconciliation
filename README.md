# Cloud Account Reconciliation

This project is for reconciling cloud account data using Python scripts.

## Project Structure

- `compare_pc_new.py` - Script for comparing datasets.
- `delete_files.py` - Script for deleting files.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.
- `datasets/` - Input data files (CSV format).
- `output/` - Output files generated by scripts.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- To compare datasets:
  ```bash
  python compare_pc_new.py
  ```
- To delete files:
  ```bash
  python delete_files.py
  ```

## Notes
- Input CSV files should be placed in the `datasets/` directory.
